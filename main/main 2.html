      <h2 class=description>What is the Web?</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      The web is a collection of documents called HTML (HyperText Markup Language) 
      that are stored on servers, or large computers placed in
      closets just for the web.
      The way the web works is someone on a computer opens a browser and requests 
      information that is stored on the servers.  The web finds the content and 
      displays it through HTML.  HTML contains hyperlinks, content
    , and images on a web page.
      The web uses HTML to display content, URL's to reference those documents, 
      HTTP which is the protocal that communicates to the servers, and web applications.
      The whole HTML document is written in code which is a text language that 
      computers can understand.

      <h2 class=description>How do you Code?</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
    HTML documents are written in code that is made up of elements. The elements contain
    tags that act as rules.  All HTML documents have to have an HTML tag for distinction,
    a head tag for title, and a body tag for contents.  Most tags must
    have an opening and a closing tag with content in between but some tags are void tags
    which end that secton of the page.  Two standard elements are considered container
    elements and they are <em>Inline</em> and <em>Block</em> elements. <em>Inline</em> means the content on the 
    page will appear like a sentence that keeps
    going, <em>Block</em> means the content will display as if it were inside of a box.
    There are different types of tags as well, void tags which is the end to a part
    of the content or tags that display something different like 
    <em>Italic</em> or <b>bold</b> characters.  <p>Coding is not something that 
    is displayed on the page but it is the reason the page is displayed the way
    it is.  Because of all the elements and tags coding is written like
    a tree where the branches organize the elements making the code easier to 
    read and navigate.  When reading code you can shorten the tree and have
    less branches and less description or lengthen the code to see every 
    element.</p></div>

      <h2 class=description>Structure and Style</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
    HTML is the framework for the document and CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is the styling for the document.
    CSS will help give the document life, it is also a language just like HTML.  The difference is CSS speaks to colors, font, and images.  CSS will change how the elements look on a page.  The style on a page is always a box everthing will fit inside of a box, it's called Boxify!  CSS like HTML uses the tree structure also known as DOM or the Document Object Model.  Because CSS is also a language like HTML it is best to write it on a seperate file and combine them on the page by using a link element.  When using CSS you should follow the process of code, test, refine. look for natural boxes first, then look for repeated styles, write your HTML, aply your styles from biggest to smallest and lastly fix things that need to be fixed.  To make it simple avoid coding repetition, this helps your document stay consistent and less errors will be made.  Assign a class to divs when styling so that all of that class will style all together as opposed to having to individually style each section.  Also when less repetition is completed your document will be a lot easier to read, make changes, or fix errors.

      <h2 class=description>Programs to Code with</h2>
  </div>
  <div>
  Programers use different kinds of programs to code.  Scratchpad, Code Pen, and Sublime Text are amongst those programs.  Scratchpad is a great starting point because it is easy to use and shows immediate results right in the program.  Code pen allows you to break down your code in sections of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Sublime Text is the most universal and in my opinion easiest to transfer to an actual HTML document.

  <h2 class=description>Help With Coding</h2>
</div>
<div>
  Coding has a lot of different elements and rules to remember.  Of course the easiest to remember are the tags and elements used most frequently like div and span.  But there is no way to remember everything.  What is recommended when help is needed is to Google it!  Typing in what is HTML will give you exactly what it is on Google and how to use it.  There are also the Udacity forums, and the Udacity classes to refer to.  Once your code is written you can validate your HTML and CSS by accessing the validation service which will also allow you to display on your document that your document has been validated.
